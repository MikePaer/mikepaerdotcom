					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<!-- <span class="date">Written May, 2020</span> -->
					<p>I&rsquo;m a musician, software engineer, and dog person.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>I&rsquo;m a classically trained pianist and composed my first album <a href="index.html">Piano
						Action!</a> back in 2008, inspired by talents like Dustin O'Halloran and Ludovico Einaudi. Then
					life happened, and while I kept playing piano privately (and started fiddling around with
					synthesizers and loop pedals), I took a break from creating new music for the public.</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward a decade to 2018 &mdash; I got a second wind and ventured into a new musical direction:
					electronic/ambient music with piano roots. After learning how to use my favorite new toy, Ableton
					Live &ndash; a digital audio workstation, I released my second full-length
					album, <a href="index.html">Momentary Masters</a>, on March 20, 2018. Inspirations include Little
					People, Emancipator, Kiasmos, Saltillo, and Niklas Paschburg.
				</p>
				<h3>Technology</h3>
				<p>I became interested in technology &amp; computers at a very young age, and that passion has stuck
					with me my whole life. I got a degree in computer engineering and joined the workforce as a
					technical product manager at a big tech company. When I&rsquo;m not making music, I&rsquo;m likely
					working on a side project &ndash; an app, tool, or website &ndash; to simplify my life, automate my
					home, or to just stay up-to-date on the latest software development trends.</p>
