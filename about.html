				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>I never enjoyed <em>practicing</em> the classical piano pieces my teacher assigned me as a kid.
					Performing them was fun, but <em>practicing</em> was a drag.
					I counted down the days until my parents would allow me to quit (which was eight years later).
				</p>
				<p>Then, something magical happened: my newfound freedom
					to play what I want,
					when I want, without pressure and assignments from my teacher, opened up a new world for me at the
					piano. I found myself playing by ear and putting
					original melodies together. I spent so much more time at the keys than I ever did while taking
					lessons.
				</p>
				<p>When I graduated high school, I published my first album of fifteen original piano compositions, <a
						href="index.html">Piano
						Action!</a>, inspired by talents like Dustin O&rsquo;Halloran and Ludovico Einaudi. For fun, I
					used MySpace (the dominant social network at the time) to casually spread the word about it to fans
					of other pianists with similar musical styles. Imagine my surprise when the album started selling
					digitally in countries around the world.
				</p>

				<p>I brought my digital piano with me to university. Playing songs by ear by request was
					my best party trick. For pocket money, I performed at a couple of banquets, weddings,
					and shows, but those events were few and far between.</p>
				<p>
					Later on, artists like Little People, Emancipator, Kiasmos, Saltillo, and Niklas Pauschberg inspired
					me to try my hand at electronic music production &mdash; an art at the intersection of music and
					technology (two of my favorite things). I bought digital
					audio workstation software called Ableton Live and started playing with it. Some experts spend a
					lifetime mastering the software and the theory behind arranging, mixing, and sound
					design &mdash; it&rsquo;s such a deep technical and creative area. This is an area I&rsquo;d love to
					spend more time to learn from a professional one day. It&rsquo;s funny how now that I'm older, I
					<em>yearn for</em> lessons and guidance from a professional again.
				<p>
					To keep me motivated on my electronic music production learning journey, I challenged myself to
					produce and
					publish a new album. After a couple months stumbling around Ableton Live with the help of YouTube
					tutorials, I finished <a href="index.html">Momentary Masters</a> and published it on March 20, 2018.
					It was a blast to work on, and I'm proud of what I was able to put together after a couple months of
					experimentation and learning. And the learning continues!
				</p>
				<h3>Technology</h3>
				<p>I became interested in technology &amp; computers at a very young age, and that passion has stuck
					with me my whole life. I got a degree in computer engineering and joined the workforce as a
					technical product manager at a big tech company. When I&rsquo;m not making music, I&rsquo;m likely
					working on a side project &ndash; an app, tool, or website &ndash; to simplify my life, automate my
					home, or to just stay up-to-date on the latest software development trends.</p>
